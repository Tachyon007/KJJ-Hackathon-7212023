This is an example of connecting the frontend(the users computer), the backend(the server handling requests), and database.
Its pretty barebones and the setup is as follows:

1. The users computer puts together a structured JSON object with things like email, the projectID for the prompt they chose, and any pictures(which get converted to text).
The client then sends this to the server.

USES: html, javascript

2. The server for this example is hosted for free on glitch.com and written in the Node.JS language
The server recives the data from the client and uses its authenticated connection to the database to store the data there.
!! NOTE: this was whipped up very quickly and is EXTREMELY vulnerable to SQL injection which makes it unsuitable for any real enviornment

USES: Node.js, SQL

3. The MySQL database holds all the data and is hosted under a personal bluehost domain
